# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Causes of Deaths in the Past Decade

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about causes of deaths over the past decade. The dataset is stored in the "data" directory, and the analysis is conducted using the Python programming language.

## Directories

The project is structured as follows:

- **bin**: This directory contains the source code files required to run the analysis.
  - `src.py`: This Python script is the main entry point for running the exploratory data analysis. It contains the code that reads the dataset and performs various data processing and visualization tasks.
  - `data_processing.py`: This script contains functions for processing the data, such as cleaning, transforming, and aggregating it for analysis purposes.
  - `Deaths_EDA.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file provides an alternative interface for running the analysis interactively. It contains the same code as `src.py` but provides easy accessablity along with a narrative.

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for the analysis.
  - `Death_DE.csv`: The CSV file that contains the data on causes of deaths over the past decade. The file is required for running the analysis. Please ensure that it is located in this directory.

- **docs**: This directory contains any documentation related to the project.
## User Guide
To use this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fahaddeshmukh/Causes-of-death-analysis


2. Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt



3. Prepare the dataset:
- Place the dataset file (e.g., `Deaths_DE.csv`) in the project directory.

4. Run the analysis:
- Open the command-line interface.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Execute the following command (make sure the directories are matching or change the directory/edit the location):
  ```
   python D:/RSE1/bin/src.py D:/RSE1/data/Death_DE.csv

  ```

5. View the results:
- The program will present the answers to the  research questions in the command-line interface. Additionally, plots will be displayed sequentially in separate windows. After viewing each plot, the corresponding window should be closed before the next plot appears.

6. You can also run the Computational Narrative file (Deaths_EDA.ipynb) which gives comprahensive overview and summary for the results.
